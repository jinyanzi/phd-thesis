\chapter{Full result of scene learning}
\label{chap:app}
In this part we give scene learning results of other videos in dataset.
\ref{fig:entry-exit-app-1} to \ref{fig:entry-exit-app-6} are the low resolution videos; while \ref{fig:entry-exit-app-7} to \ref{fig:entry-exit-app-9} are high resolutions with more complex interactions among vehicles.

The first ``topic'' in \ref{fig:entry-exit-app-1} has slightly mixed motion on the opposite direction.
\ref{fig:entry-exit-app-2} has some fragmentary topics due to the noise caused by poor image quality and camera jittering.
In general video with higher resolution have better results because they are less noisy.
