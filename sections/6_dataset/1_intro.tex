\section{Introduction}

With the progress in artificial intelligence and higher demand in its application, computer vision is becoming one the hottest areas. 
Computer vision enables computers to perform tasks that used to be achieved only by human, such as visual detection and tracking. 
With the superior advantage of computational speed, such tasks could be completed with a much faster speed.

Computer vision algorithm has been a major tool for intelligence transportation field, including traffic monitoring and analysis, anomaly detection. 
However, there lacks a comprehensive dataset in the community.

Usually, such applications are designed and developed by an agent with access to a certain kind of camera, for a specific task, therefore, quite restricted to the camera setting and applicability.
On the other hand, due to the pervasive use of traffic camera, it is easy to have a mass of videos of 24/7. However, most of the time, there is little annotation due to the expensive labor cost. 
Therefore, it is hard to carry out quantitative evaluation for those tasks.
