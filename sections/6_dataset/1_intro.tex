\section{Introduction}


Computer vision algorithm has been a major tool for intelligence transportation field, including traffic monitoring and analysis, anomaly detection. 
However, there lacks a comprehensive dataset in the community.

Usually, such applications are designed and developed by an agent with access to a certain kind of camera, for a specific task, therefore, quite restricted to the camera setting and applicability.
On the other hand, due to the pervasive use of traffic camera, it is easy to have a mass of videos of 24/7. However, most of the time, there is little annotation due to the expensive labor cost. 
Therefore, it is hard to carry out quantitative evaluation for those tasks.
