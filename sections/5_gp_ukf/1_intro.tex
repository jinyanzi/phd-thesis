\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:gp-ukf-intro}

The basic assumption in \S\ref{sec:tracker-kf} is that vehicles follow the constant acceleration model in a short period, like in the physical world.
However, everything the scene experiences distortion under projection in most traffic videos. Therefore, vehicles' movement does not follow the linear model in \ref{eq:linear-model}, and a linear state model is insufficient for the Kalman Filter to capture the movement pattern of the vehicles in the scene.

When good observations are available consistently, the Kalman filter is able to follow the tracked vehicle, even though the linear model cannot accurately reflect the size and velocity change. 
With missing observation or occlusion, the tracker is expected to make prediction with its internal model in the \emph{extrapolation} mode. 
However, with the linear model broken, the tracker can only generate reasonable results for a short period.

To tackle this problem, we proposed an \gls{ukf} tracker, which learns a non-linear model from the history trajectories by \gls{gp}. 
The semantic knowledge is the prerequisite of the non-linear model, which ensures the trajectories of a high quality.
Under the constraints of semantic learning, every vehicle that survives to the exit hotspot is consistent with its motion topic in terms of entry/exit location, size and velocity.
