\label{sec:intro-cv}


With the progress in artificial intelligence and higher demand in its application, computer vision is becoming one the hottest areas. 
Computer vision enables computers to perform tasks that used to be achieved only by human, such as visual detection and tracking. 
With the superior advantage of computational speed, such tasks could be completed with a much faster speed.

With the progress of the hardware, the cost of camera has been significantly reduces, which results in the prevalence of the surveillance camera. 
Compared with the traditional heavy equipment, they are more lightweight and easier to set up.
They run continuously and cover large area of the interested area. 
With the abundant video data, therefore, it is highly demanded to efficiently index and extract useful information for surveillance task.
