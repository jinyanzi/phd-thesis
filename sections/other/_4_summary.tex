As the reduced manufacturing cost of camera brings the prevalence of surveillance camera, people are putting more effort on efficient information retrieval from surveillance videos.
On the other hand, surveillance videos are becoming a separate subject for academic study, due to their spacial features and wide applications.
However, there remains a huge gap between academic computer vision research and application. 
Parties in the possession of a large amount of videos lack systematic methodology for different tasks;
while the research community has little access to data with the same amount and complexity real-world data, algorithm performance also has a higher priority over practical bottlenecks in real-world application, such as throughput and automation.

This thesis aims to bridge the gap between the state-of-the-art computer vision research and real-world application.
We first address the critical problem of proper initialization and termination in object tracking algorithm, and propose a heuristic method for automatic initialization and termination.
Then we work on learning the scene-specific semantic knowledge and apply them for other surveillance tasks such as vehicle tracking and counting.
We demonstrate the performance improvement by the heuristic method and further boost by the semantic knowledge.

With feasibility for real-world deployment being the prerequisite, our methods are end-to-end without human input and run in real-time. 
Finally, we annotate and release a comprehensive dataset for the community.
