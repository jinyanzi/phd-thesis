I would like thank my advisor Dr. Jakob Eriksson throughout these years for his support and instructions.
He is very visionary about this interesting and challenging project. 
I admire his academic attitude and time he spent to learn together with students.
I appreciate the time that we went through the code line by line for a hidden bug or hours of discussion of algorithm details. 
Thanks to his generous freedom and support, I got comprehensive training and became independent and mature in research.

Also, I would like express appreciation to my committee members, for their advice and inspiration. 
I took their classes and learned preliminary knowledge of different research areas. 
Specifically I want to thank Dr. Xinhua Zhang, whose rigorous attitude toward research and passion of teaching greatly inspired me. 
And Dr. Jie Yang's rich experience gave me helpful guidance of many technical questions.

In addition, I want to thank my parents and sister.
My father teaches me to be strong and tough; my mother supports me for all my big decisions; my sister takes care of my parents when I am far away.
Finally, special thanks to Sihong Xie, for his accompany and encouragement along this tough journey.
