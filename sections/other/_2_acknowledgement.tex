I want to thank my advisor Dr. Jakob Eriksson throughout these years for his support and instructions.
He is very visionary about this exciting and challenging project. 
I admire his academic attitude and the effort he spent to learn together with students.
I appreciate the time that we went through the code line by line for a hidden bug or hours of discussion of algorithm details. 
Thanks to his generous freedom and support, I received comprehensive training and became independent and mature in research.

Also, I would like to express appreciation to my committee members, for their advice and inspiration. 
I took their classes and learned preliminary knowledge of different research areas, contributing to the building blocks of my research project. 
Specifically, I want to thank Dr. Xinhua Zhang, whose rigorous attitude toward research and passion of teaching greatly inspired me. 
Also, Dr. Jie Yang's rich experience gave me helpful guidance on multiple technical questions.

In addition, I want to thank my parents and sister.
My father teaches me to be strong and tough; my mother supports me for all my big decisions; my sister takes care of my parents when I am far away.
Finally, special thanks to Sihong Xie, for his company and encouragement along this tough journey.
